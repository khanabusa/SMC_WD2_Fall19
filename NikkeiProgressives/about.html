            <h2>Where We’re From</h2> 
                <p>Rooted in Los Angeles’ Little Tokyo, Nikkei Progressives carries on the values and principles of earlier groups, like the Little Tokyo Peoples Rights Organization (LTPRO) that worked to preserve Little Tokyo during the City’s 1970s redevelopment and Nikkei for Civil Rights & Redress (NCRR) that led the grassroots struggle for Redress and Reparations and supported Muslim Americans following 9/11. Many of us are also members of Sustainable Little Tokyo (SLT) and work to promote community control in the face of growing gentrification.</p>

            <h2>What We Stand For</h2>
                <p>We support the human and civil rights of immigrants, Muslim Americans and other groups who face marginalization and discrimination. We believe in building bridges and solidarity between people, not walls, registries and travel bans. We believe families belong together, children separated from their parents must be reunited immediately, and migrants and asylum seekers deserve safety and freedom from violence and modern-day prison camps. We believe Little Tokyo is the heart of the Southern California Japanese American community. Its 135-year history, culture, values, legacy businesses, and community institutions must be protected for future generations.</p>
