            <h2>Never Again Is Now Campaign</h2>
            <button class="button-a" type="submit">Read More</button>
            <p class="blog-a" style="display: none">The WWII incarceration of Japanese Americans inspires us today to fight to defend the civil liberties of many people from the racist and inhumane policies of the Trump administration. We see Muslims being banned from entering the country, children being torn from their parents at the border, and families being held in indefinite detention -- the parallels with our history are vividly clear. In the name of our parents, grandparents and great grandparents, we vow Never Again!</p>

            <h2>Families Belong Together Quilt</h2>
            <button class="button-b" type="submit">Read More</button>
            <p class="blog-b" style="display: none">The Families Belong Together Quilt is a creative, visual way to involve a wide variety of people and groups who are willing to design and produce or sponsor a canvas “square” to be a part of a quilt. The theme for the quilt is to express support for immigrant right, which can be expressed in many creative ways.</p>

            <button class="button-c" type="submit">Read More</button>
            <p class="blog-c" style="display: none">We've been down this road before. We are former World War II internees, their children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren, and friends. We remember that 75 years ago the Japanese American community was forcibly removed from their homes and imprisoned in camps around the country - in an act motivated by racism and hysteria - that deprived our family members of their freedom, rights, privacy, property, and in some cases, their lives.</p>
